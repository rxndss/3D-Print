host: 0.0.0.0
port: 7125
klippy_uds_address: /tmp/klippy_uds
#   The address of Unix Domain Socket used to communicate with Klippy. Default
#   is /tmp/klippy_uds
max_upload_size: 1024
#   The maximum size allowed for a file upload (in MiB).  Default is 1024 MiB.
enable_debug_logging: False
#   When set to True Moonraker will log in verbose mode.  During this stage
#   of development the default is False.

[file_manager]
config_path: ~/klipper_config
#   The path to a directory where configuration files are located. This
#   directory may contain Klipper config files (printer.cfg) or Moonraker
#   config files (moonraker.conf).  Clients may also write their own config
#   files to this directory.  Note that this may not be the system root
#   (ie: "/") and moonraker must have read and write access permissions
#   for this directory.
log_path: ~/klipper_logs
#   An optional path to a directory where log files are located.  Users may
#   configure various applications to store logs here and Moonraker will serve
#   them at "/server/files/logs/*".  The default is no log paths.
queue_gcode_uploads: False
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.
enable_object_processing: False
#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metadata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's
#   "cancel object" functionality.  Note that this process is file I/O intensive,
#   it is not recommended for usage on low resource SBCs such as a Pi Zero.
#   The default is False.
