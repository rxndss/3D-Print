[verify_heater heater_bed]
max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
check_gain_time: 60
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating.  Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.

cycle_time: 0.05
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. When

#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.
